# Equipment

The root of your next Python project

## Overview

Equipment is a scaffold project for building Python applications with a focus on simplicity, extensibility, and maintainability.

It provides a set of tools and libraries that can be used to build robust and maintainable applications.

### Dependency Injection
- Easy dependency injection for building robust and maintainable applications
- Supports both class-based and function-based dependencies

### Project Initialization
- Easy project creation with a standardized template
- Quick setup for new Python projects by running a single command: `equipment new my-app`

### Logging Management
- Flexible logging configuration
- Multiple log channels and formatters
- Simple logging API for easy implementation

### Scheduling
- Built-in task scheduler
- Support for periodic and recurring tasks
- Seamless integration with queue systems

### Queue Management
- Supports both synchronous and Redis-based queues
- Asynchronous task processing
- Easy task enqueuing and scheduling

### Database migrations and ORM
- SQLAlchemy integration
- Multiple database driver support
- Built-in migration support via Alembic

### Storage Management, either Local or Cloud
- Filesystem abstraction layer
- Local storage driver
- Extensible storage configuration

## Quick Start

Equipment project includes a class that generates inspiring quotes as an example.
It uses the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the class exists, and a configuration file managed by Equipment.

### Installation
```bash
# Install Equipment
pip install equipment pipenv

# Generate a new project
equipment new my-app

# Install dependencies
cd my-app && pipenv install
```

### Usage

By default, equipment generates various entrypoints for the project.
- **main.py**: The main entrypoint for the application. It includes examples of how to use Equipment.
- **scheduler.py**: The entrypoint for the task scheduler.
- **queues.py**: The entrypoint for the queue system, using either Redis or synchronous queues.
- **web.py**: The entrypoint for the web server, based on FastAPI.

```bash
cd my-app

# Run the main script
py main.py

# Run the scheduler
py scheduler.py

# Enqueue tasks
py queues.py

# Run the web server
py web.py
```

## Under the hood

Equipment uses popular libraries and frameworks to avoid reinventing the wheel and provide a solid foundation for building robust and maintainable applications:

- [Dependency Injector](https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/) as container service
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) as ORM
- [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) for database migrations
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) as queue driver
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as web framework
- [Schedule](https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as task scheduler
