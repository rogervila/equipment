# Project Directory Structure

## Overview

The project follows a modular and organized directory structure designed to promote clean code organization, separation of concerns, and maintainability. Each directory serves a specific purpose in the application architecture.

## Key Directories

### `app/`
**Purpose**: Core Application Logic
- Contains the primary business logic and application components
- Project services are defined in `app/__init__.py`
- Responsible for implementing the primary features of the project

### `config/`
**Purpose**: Configuration Management
- Stores configuration files in yaml, json, and ini formats
- Manages application settings, environment variables, and global configurations
- Supports flexible configuration across different deployment scenarios

### `database/`
**Purpose**: Database Migrations
- Contains database migrations powered by alembic

### `storage/`
**Purpose**: Flexible Filesystem API
- Implements a robust and flexible file storage interface
- Supports operations like:
  - File writing
  - File reading
  - File moving
  - File removal
- Provides a consistent API for file system interactions across different storage backends

### `tests/`
**Purpose**: Quality Assurance
- Contains comprehensive test suite
- Includes:
  - Unit tests for individual components
  - Integration tests for system-wide functionality
- Ensures code reliability and catches potential issues early in the development process

## Additional Entry Points

### `main.py`
- Primary application entry point
- Initializes and starts the application

### `scheduler.py`
- Manages scheduled tasks and background jobs
- Implements task scheduling and execution logic

### `queues.py`
- Handles background task processing
- Manages task queues and asynchronous job execution

### `web.py`
- Implements web server configuration
- Defines routes and web application endpoints

## Best Practices

- Each directory has a specific, well-defined responsibility
- Modular design allows for easy extension and maintenance
- Separation of concerns improves code readability and testability
